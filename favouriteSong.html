      <span><b>[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]</b></span>
      <br />
      I'm tired of being what you want me to be
      <br />
      I don't know what you're
      <br />
      Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface expecting of me
      <br />
      Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
    </p>

    <p>
      <span><b>[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]</b></span>
      <br />
      Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
      <br />
      Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br />
      Caught in the undertow, just caughtin the undertow
    </p>
    <p>
      <span><b>[Chorus: Chester Bennington]</b></span>
      <br />
      I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
      <br />
      Become so tired, so much more aware
      <br />I'm becoming this, all I want to do
      <br />
      Is be more like me and be less like you
    </p>
    <p>
      <span><b>[Verse 2: Chester Bennington] </b></span>
      <br />
      Can't you see that you're smothering me?
      <br />
      Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
      <br />
      'Cause everything that you thought
      <br />
      I would be Has fallen apart, right in front of you
    </p>

    <p>
      <span><b>[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda] </b></span>
      <br />
      Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
      <br />
      Every step that I take is another mistake to you
      <br />
      Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
      <br />
      And every second I waste is more than I can take
    </p>
